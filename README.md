# MITM 

An HTTPS main-in-the-middle proxy, built using [Pingora](https://docs.rs/pingora). 

The proxy automatically generates (or if it exists loads) a Certificate Authority, PEM encoded, at `~/.mitm/ca.crt` and `~/.mitm/ca.key`.  

> **NOTE:**
> The Certificate Authority is stored in the active user's home directory. If you run `sudo mitm start -p 443 ...`, the CA will be created or loaded in the root user's home directory instead of your own.

That certificate authority is then used for any web requests.  That is, the proxy auto generates leaf certificates by the Certificate Authority based on the incoming (downstream) SNI.  Leaf certificates are saved to disk when generated, cached when requested, and the cache is populated when the proxy starts.

This proxy can be helpful for decrypting TLS traffic if you can: 

1) Force the traffic to the listening port of the proxy
2) Install the Certificate Authority (`~/.mitm/ca.crt`) into the appropriate certificate store of the downstream client. 

There is an interesting feature, enabled by the `-W` flag to the `start` sub command, that I'm calling [Wireshark Mode](#wireshark-mode).

Since Pingora natively supports WebSockets, this MITM proxy transparently handles WebSocket connections as wellâ€”no additional configuration required.

## Usage

### Commands:

```
mitm           # same as `mitm start`
mitm start     # runs a https mitm server listening on localhost:6188
mitm start -h  # Shows all the options
mitm start -c "path/to/upstream_ca_store.crt"   # Specify an upstream cert store 
RUST_LOG=debug mitm start -l "127.0.0.1:1443" -W 2443 -u "127.0.0.1:3443" -k
```

### mitm start help menu: 

```
Start the MITM Proxy

Usage: mitm start [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -p, --listening-port <LISTENING_PORT>
          Proxy listening port [default: 6188]
  -c, --ca-file <CA_FILE>
          Optional CA_File to use for the upstream TLS connection
  -i, --ignore-hostname-check
          Ignore the upstream hostname check, Default = False
  -k, --ignore-cert
          Ignore the upstream certificate, Default = False
  -s, --sni <SNI>
          Set the upstream SNI, otherwise uses the downstream SNI
  -u, --upstream <UPSTREAM>
          Specify a static origin for all upstream requests.
          When not supplied, it'll dynamically look up upstream by downstream SNI (or hostname if it is http).
          This is useful for testing or forcing all traffic to a single backend.
          Takes SocketAddrs, Eg: "127.0.0.1:443", "localhost:443"
  -t, --upstream-ssl-keys
          If this option is enabled, and the env variable SSLKEYLOGFILE is set, the upstream SSL keys will be written to that file
  -W, --wireshark-mode <WIRESHARK_MODE>
          Pass a port number that all traffic will be routed through on localhost for wireshark capture
  -h, --help
          Print help
```

### Sub Commands:

```
# Generates a Certificate Authority in $HOME/.mitm
mitm ca init
# Generate a leaf certificate signed by CA 
mitm ca sign -s "host.example.com" 
```

## Normal Proxy mode (mitm start)

A straight forward HTTPS proxy service: 

```
+---------------------+     +-----------+     +------------------------+
| Client (Downstream) | --> |   MITM    | --> | HTTPS Server (Upstream)|
+---------------------+     +-----------+     +------------------------+
```

In this example: 

```
RUST_LOG=debug mitm start -l "127.0.0.1:1443" -u "127.0.0.1:3443" -k
```

The proxy will listen (`-l`) on `127.0.0.1:1443`, sending all upstream (`-u`) traffic to `127.0.0.1:3443`, ignoring the certificate's validity (`-k`).  Additionally, the log level is set by the environment variable `RUST_LOG`.

## Wireshark Mode 

A proxy composed of two components: 

```
+--------+     +-----------+     +-----------+     +--------------+
| Client | --> | Service A | --> | Service B | --> | HTTPS Server |
+--------+     +-----------+     +-----------+     +--------------+
```

In this mode, the traffic between Service A and Service B traverses the loopback interface unencrypted. That is, open up Wireshark on the loopback interface and use the filter `tcp.port == 4076`.  The port (4076) is passed with the `-W` flag.  Eg: 

```
mitm start -u "127.0.0.1:443" -i -k -W 4076
```

## TODO:
* Currently only linux is supported, think it would be trivial to get working on MacOS / Windows
* The cert returned is just the leaf certificate, and not a chain... should it be a chain?
* Make CA fields customizeable
* Make leaf certificates customizeable
* Do a full one-over on logging... Logging is inconsistent at the moment. 
* Remove unwraps and panics, in favor of returning Results, ? operator... 
* Flamegraph, what takes the longest on a request with a cached certificate (think it could be faster)
* Make more tests (only 2 exist in ca.rs)

## Maybe:
* Create a DNS server, that only responds with the address of the MITM proxy? 
* Create a local server, for responding to requests, calling this a stub above
* Create a web interface?

## Useful commands for testing: 

### Verifying a leaf certificate against a CA:

```
openssl verify -CAfile ca.crt example.com.crt
```

### Test setup commands: 

```
cargo run -- ca sign -s "example.com"
sudo gotestserver serve -s --cert "$HOME/.mitm/example.com.crt" --key "$HOME/.mitm/example.sundquist.com.key"
cargo run -- start -c "$HOME/.mitm/ca.crt"
curl https://example.com/request --connect-to ::127.0.0.1:6188 -svk 
```
